**Sketch A Mesh** is a device for creating lineographic shapes in 3D space, using limited hardware controls to create loose, sketch-like objects and scenes. Inspired by the simplicity of early 3D computer graphics and prompted by experiments using Arduino to control openFrameworks projects, the final version is compiled for Raspberry Pi, allowing the **Sketch A Mesh** to run as a standalone device on internal battery power.
